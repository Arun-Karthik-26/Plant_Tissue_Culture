Plant Tissue Culture
Introduction
Plant tissue culture is a technique used to grow plants under sterile conditions in a controlled environment. It involves cultivating plant cells, tissues, or organs in nutrient-rich media to regenerate whole plants. This method is widely used in agriculture, horticulture, and research for mass propagation, genetic improvement, and conservation of plant species.

Process of Plant Tissue Culture
1. Selection of Plant Material
Healthy and disease-free plant tissues (such as leaves, stems, or meristematic cells) are selected for culture.
The choice of plant material depends on the purpose of the culture (e.g., propagation, genetic modification, or disease resistance).
2. Sterilization
To prevent contamination, plant material is sterilized using chemical agents like ethanol, sodium hypochlorite, or mercury chloride.
Culture vessels, tools, and media are also sterilized using an autoclave.
3. Preparation of Culture Medium
The growth medium contains essential nutrients, vitamins, and plant growth regulators.
Commonly used media include Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium and Gamborgâ€™s B5 medium.
The medium may be solidified using agar or remain in liquid form for different culture techniques.
4. Inoculation and Incubation
The sterilized plant material is placed into the culture medium under aseptic conditions in a laminar airflow chamber.
The cultures are incubated under controlled temperature, light, and humidity to promote growth.
5. Callus Formation & Organogenesis
In some cases, the plant tissue forms an undifferentiated mass called callus before developing into shoots and roots.
Organogenesis refers to the formation of new organs (shoots or roots) from the callus under the influence of growth hormones like auxins and cytokinins.
6. Rooting and Hardening
Once shoots develop, they are transferred to rooting media to promote root formation.
The young plants are then gradually adapted to external environmental conditions in a greenhouse or nursery.
